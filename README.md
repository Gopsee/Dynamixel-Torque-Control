Torque control on a smart actuator. Dynamixel XH540 W270-R


DYNAMIXEL

The DYNAMIXEL is a smart actuator system developed to be the exclusive connecting joints on a robot or mechanical structure. DYNAMIXELS’ are designed to be modular and daisy chained on any robot or mechanical design for powerful and flexible robotic movements. The DYNAMIXEL is a high performance actuator with a fully integrated DC (Direct Current) Motor + Reduction Gearhead + Controller + Driver + Network, all in one servo module actuator. 
Programmable and networkable, actuator status can be read and monitored through a data packet stream.

DYNAMIXEL

The DYNAMIXEL is a smart actuator system developed to be the exclusive connecting joints on a robot or mechanical structure. DYNAMIXELSâ€™ are designed to be modular and daisy chained on any robot or mechanical design for powerful and flexible robotic movements. The DYNAMIXEL is a high performance actuator with a fully integrated DC (Direct Current) Motor + Reduction Gearhead + Controller + Driver + Network, all in one servo module actuator. 
Programmable and networkable, actuator status can be read and monitored through a data packet stream. 


POSITION CONTROL

Goal Position
Desired position can be set with Goal Position(116). From the front view of Dynamixels, CCW is an increasing direction whereas CW is a decreasing direction. The way to reaching Goal Position(116) is differ by 4 Profiles provided by Dynamixels. Please refer to the Profile Velocity(112) for more details.
